I admire the Dodgeroll mechanic of Terraria Overhaul. It promotes Horizontal Maneuvers, rather than forcing the Player to fly circles around their enemies.

But some people just want standalone mechanics. Since the Dodgeroll is not a mod of its own, I took it upon myself to execute the idea in a more basic form.

**What This Does**
-You can now dodge attacks using the provided hotkey.
-When dodging, you are lunged in the direction you are facing/moving. (configurable)
-During this action, a certain amount of Mana is consumed. (configurable)
-You may perform Vertical Dodges by holding "Up" while Dodging. (configurable. Off by default.)


-Credits-
Joost: Gave me a brief guide on how to set this up.
Scooterboot: Showed me a few other ways of checking how the player moves to apply horizontal movement, as well as the method used for the Dodge Cooldown.
absoluteAquarian: Pointed out to me that it's actually pretty simple to apply Added Velocity, that way I can replace the Fixed Velocity in favor of it.
ID Software: Dodge sounds.
Re-Logic - New Mod Icon.


-v0.1-
-Initial build.

-v0.2-
-Both the on-ground and mid-air dodges have had their velocity reduced from 7 to 5. (Thanks for the new calculation method, Scoot.)
-You can no longer use items while dodging.

-v0.2.1-
-Removed the function of delaying the player's Item Use until I find a better method.

-v0.2.2-
-Rather than a fixed Velocity, Dodging adds onto it.
-Reduced applied Velocity from 5 to 4.

-v0.2.3-
-Velocity when on ground is 5. If mid-air, it is 3.

-v0.2.4-
-Added a sound for Dodging.

-Added a Homepage.

-v0.3-
-Updated the mod to tModLoader 1.4.
-Removed unnecessary content.

-v0.4-
-To improve upon the balance of this mod, performing a Dodge now consumes 20 Mana. If the Player's Mana is below 20, they will not be able to Dodge.

-v0.4.1-

-Added the option to disable Dodge Mana Consumption.
